### Definition
- wifi
- cellular


### Need

This demo is not complete, need to improve

### Note
- If app target android 24, don't register CONNECTIVITY_ACTION broadcast in manifest.
However, we can register broadcast by `Context.registerReceiver()`. However CONNECTIVITY_ACTION
constant was deprecated in API level 28 => use another way for listen connection change
